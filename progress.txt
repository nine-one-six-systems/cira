[2026-01-18] Iteration 1
- Pattern: Security middleware should be initialized before other extensions in Flask app factory to ensure headers are applied consistently
- Pattern: Use get_secure_download_headers() utility for all file downloads to ensure consistent security headers
- Gotcha: Company model uses `company_name` field, not `name` - check model definitions before writing test fixtures
- Gotcha: Python 3.14 on this machine uses `python3` command, not `python`
- Tip: Backend test suite with pytest can be run from backend/ directory: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Tip: Frontend tests run with `npm test` from frontend/ directory
- Tip: mypy is not installed in the current environment - type checking skipped
---
[2026-01-18] Iteration 2 - Final Phase 10 Completion
- Pattern: Accessibility features were already implemented in UI components - always search codebase before assuming something is missing
- Pattern: Code splitting with React.lazy() should use Suspense with fallback for smooth loading experience
- Pattern: SQLAlchemy connection pooling needs pool_pre_ping=True for connection health checks
- Gotcha: SQLite doesn't support the same connection pooling options as other databases - use minimal config for testing
- Gotcha: ESLint react-refresh/only-export-components warning is non-blocking - occurs when exporting non-component items
- Tip: Playwright E2E tests should use .or() for alternative selectors to handle different UI implementations
- Tip: E2E tests should use isVisible().catch(() => false) for robust element checking
- Achievement: All Phase 10 tasks complete - Task 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.7 verified/implemented

[2026-01-18] Iteration 3 - Lint Fix
- Pattern: react-refresh/only-export-components errors can be fixed by moving non-component exports (utility functions) to separate files
- Pattern: Hooks that are tightly coupled with their providers (like useToast + ToastProvider) can use eslint-disable comment as a valid exception
- Gotcha: Moving exports to new files requires updating test imports and verifying re-exports from index.ts
- Tip: Always run both lint AND tests after restructuring exports to catch import issues
- Achievement: Fixed ESLint errors in Badge.tsx and Toast.tsx, created v0.0.6 tag

[2026-01-18] Iteration 4 - Verification
- Pattern: All tasks confirmed complete through test execution (1049 backend, 167 frontend)
- Tip: Backend tests have deprecation warnings for datetime.utcnow() - future work could migrate to timezone-aware datetime.now(datetime.UTC)
- Achievement: Project verification complete - all tests passing, git tag v0.0.6 is latest
---
[2026-01-18] Iteration 5 - Final Verification
- Pattern: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md contains `- [ ]` checkboxes within Test Requirements sections - these describe test coverage criteria, not task status
- Pattern: Actual task completion is indicated by `✅` symbols and entries in the "Completed Tasks" section
- Achievement: All tests pass - Backend: 1049 passed (271s), Frontend: 167 passed (7s), Lint clean
- Achievement: Project confirmed COMPLETE - all Phases 1-10 finished
---
[2026-01-18] Iteration 6 - Verification Confirmation
- Achievement: Re-verified all tests passing - Backend: 1049 passed (269s), Frontend: 167 passed (5.4s), Lint clean
- Achievement: Git tag v0.0.7 is the latest tag
- Achievement: Project status verified COMPLETE - no remaining tasks
