## Notes

**Research Context Drivers:**
- Company research needs arise from specific business events: new prospect identification, RFP responses, partnership discussions, contract renewals, competitive monitoring
- Research depth requirements vary: sometimes a quick overview suffices, other times comprehensive due diligence is essential
- Output format matters: informal internal notes vs. formal external presentations have different requirements

**Key Insight:**
The primary value proposition is not just automation, but **consistency and comprehensiveness**. Users currently can do manual research, but the quality varies based on time available, researcher skill, and source discovery. CIRA ensures every company gets the same thorough treatment, surfacing information that might otherwise be missed.

**Adoption Considerations:**
- Users will initially run CIRA alongside manual research to validate quality
- Trust builds as users verify AI-generated insights against known information
- Batch processing becomes the killer feature once trust is established
- Re-scan capability creates ongoing engagement beyond initial analysis
