[2026-01-18] Iteration 1
- Pattern: Security middleware should be initialized before other extensions in Flask app factory to ensure headers are applied consistently
- Pattern: Use get_secure_download_headers() utility for all file downloads to ensure consistent security headers
- Gotcha: Company model uses `company_name` field, not `name` - check model definitions before writing test fixtures
- Gotcha: Python 3.14 on this machine uses `python3` command, not `python`
- Tip: Backend test suite with pytest can be run from backend/ directory: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Tip: Frontend tests run with `npm test` from frontend/ directory
- Tip: mypy is not installed in the current environment - type checking skipped

[2026-01-18] Iteration 2 - Final Phase 10 Completion
- Pattern: Accessibility features were already implemented in UI components - always search codebase before assuming something is missing
- Pattern: Code splitting with React.lazy() should use Suspense with fallback for smooth loading experience
- Pattern: SQLAlchemy connection pooling needs pool_pre_ping=True for connection health checks
- Gotcha: SQLite doesn't support the same connection pooling options as other databases - use minimal config for testing
- Gotcha: ESLint react-refresh/only-export-components warning is non-blocking - occurs when exporting non-component items
- Tip: Playwright E2E tests should use .or() for alternative selectors to handle different UI implementations
- Tip: E2E tests should use isVisible().catch(() => false) for robust element checking
- Achievement: All Phase 10 tasks complete - Task 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.7 verified/implemented

[2026-01-18] Iteration 3 - Lint Fix
- Pattern: react-refresh/only-export-components errors can be fixed by moving non-component exports (utility functions) to separate files
- Pattern: Hooks that are tightly coupled with their providers (like useToast + ToastProvider) can use eslint-disable comment as a valid exception
- Gotcha: Moving exports to new files requires updating test imports and verifying re-exports from index.ts
- Tip: Always run both lint AND tests after restructuring exports to catch import issues
- Achievement: Fixed ESLint errors in Badge.tsx and Toast.tsx, created v0.0.6 tag
